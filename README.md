Automatic Sanitizer Dispenser

1.Overview

This project demonstrates a touchless, automatic sanitizer dispenser created during the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020). The dispenser uses an ultrasonic sensor and custom-built PCB to spray sanitizer when a hand is detected near the nozzle. The device was designed to reduce contact, ensuring hygiene.

2.Features

- Touchless Operation: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect hands.
- Custom-Built PCB: Reduced costs compared to using an Arduino board.
- High-Performance Components: Supports a 24V DC pump and solenoid valve for effective sanitizer dispensing.

3.How It Works

1. Detection: The ultrasonic sensor detects a hand placed near the nozzle.
2. Activation: Once detected, the PCB activates the relay, powering the pump and solenoid.
3. Dispensing: The sanitizer is sprayed from the nozzle for 5 seconds.
4. Reset: The circuit resets, ready for the next use.

 Setup and Usage
 Using Arduino (Initial Testing)

1. Connections:

   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to Arduino pins:
     - VCC -> 5V pin.
     - GND -> GND.
     - Trig -> Digital Pin (e.g., D9).
     - Echo -> Digital Pin (e.g., D10).
   - Connect the relay signal pin to a digital output pin (e.g., D8).
   - Connect the pump and solenoid to the relay output terminals.
   - Power the circuit with an external 24V DC adapter.

2. Code:

   - Upload the Arduino sketch to the microcontroller.
   - Ensure the timing and distance thresholds match your requirements.


6.Using Custom PCB

1. Connect Components:

   - Attach the pump and solenoid to their respective terminals on the PCB.
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to its designated port.
   - Supply 24V DC power to the adapter ports.

2. Activate:

   - Power on the circuit and test by placing your hand near the nozzle.

3. Calibration:

   - Adjust the PCBâ€™s potentiometers if needed for sensitivity or timing.
